## Description

### (i)String.js
Created a function named changeCase which toggles the case of each character to a given string and converts uppercase letters to lowercase and vice versa.

### (ii)array.js
The Range Generator is a simple JavaScript function where I used concepts such as loops and arrays. This project provides a function that generates a range of numbers between a specified start and end value which was provided in the task between two array's of numbers [4, 7]
and also between [-4, 7].

### (iii)prime.js
PrimeNumber(num): This function checks whether a given number num is a prime number or not. It returns true if the number is prime and false otherwise.

printRespectivePrimeNumbers(n): This function prints all prime numbers up to a given number n by iterating through numbers from 2 to n and using the primeNumber function to determine if each number is prime
